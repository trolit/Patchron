# Detective Pepega

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) which is meant to help in maintaining development conventions by performing early pull request code review. CR is based on patches that contain limited number of information from modified files. Due to this, some review comments might not be accurate, but still, those are edge cases (e.g. patch which is fragment of multi-line string or differentiating interpolated code from raw string) which can be ignored when reviewed by PR owner.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Docker

```sh
# 1. Build container
docker build -t pepega .

# 2. Start container
docker run -e APP_ID=<app-id> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> pepega
```
