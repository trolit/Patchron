app that supports team in maintaining simple project conventions and speeds up further code review excluding simple cases once PR is issued.

#### Disclaimers ‚ùó

-   review is based upon **patches** which contain limited number of information. Due to that, some comments might be unrelevant to the situation. Despite of that, it comes to clicking resolve button while at the same time reviewers don't have to focus on simple things.

-   review won't work on minified files. Beautifying patches is not an option due to possibility of receiving only part of code.

-   app was tested on basic Prettier configuration ([tabWidth](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#tab-width): 4, [printWidth](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#print-width): 80)
