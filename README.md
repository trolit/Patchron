# Patchron

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that implements set of rules to perform early pull request review and comment out cases that do not meet configuration. Please note that review is based on patches which **contain limited number of information**. Due to that you may find some review comments to not be relevant to the situation but still `Patchron` can be used to simplify next code reviews done by humans and maintain conventions.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Docker

```sh
# 1. Build container
docker build -t patchron .

# 2. Start container
docker run -e APP_ID=<app-id> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> patchron
```

## Settings

| Property                               | Type (default)       | Description                                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isGetFilesRequestPaginated`           | boolean (`false`)    | Controls how files are fetched. Unpaginated response includes a maximum of 3000 files which is sufficient in 99.99% of cases. |
| `delayBetweenCommentRequestsInSeconds` | Number (`3`)         | After review is done, delays time between each comment request to not overload API.                                           |
| `isOwnerAssigningEnabled`              | boolean (`true`)     | When true, PR owner will be automatically assigned once pull request will be issued.                                          |
| `isReviewSummaryEnabled`               | boolean (`false`)    | When true, at the end of the PR review summary is posted that contains various information e.g. how many comments were posts. |
| `isStoringLogsEnabled`                 | boolean (`true`)     | When true, stores logs physically in `/.logs` directory.                                                                      |
| `maxCommentsPerReview`                 | Number (`25`)        | Limit number of comments that can be posted in single review under single PR.                                                 |
| `senders`                              | Array<string> (`[]`) | Allows to limit pull requests reviews to certain users. Pass GitHub usernames.                                                |
